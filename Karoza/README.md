# Simion Karoza Portfolio

This is a simple, modern, and responsive personal portfolio website.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main file containing the website structure and styles.
- `profile.jpeg`: Your profile picture (renamed from the original WhatsApp image).

## How to Use

1. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
2. To edit the content, open `index.html` in a text editor (like VS Code or Notepad).

## Customization

- **Colors**: You can change the colors in the `:root` section at the top of the `<style>` block in `index.html`.
- **Image**: Replace `profile.jpeg` with another image if needed, keeping the same name, or update the `src` attribute in the HTML.
- **Links**: Update the `href` in the "Get in Touch" button to your actual email address.

## Deployment

To share this with the world, you can upload these files to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
